    <h1>Dolphins</h1>

    <p>A <b>dolphin</b> is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea.
        Dolphin species belong to the families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river
        dolphins),
        Iniidae (the New World river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji
        or Chinese river dolphin).
        There are 40 extant species named as dolphins</p>

    <p>Dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5
        m (31 ft) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Various species of dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism where the
        males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers.
        Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can briefly travel at speeds of 29 kilometres per hour (18
        mph) or leap about 9 metres (30 ft).[1] Dolphins use their conical teeth to capture fast-moving prey. They have
        well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water. It is so well developed that some can survive
        even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or
        blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The name is originally from Greek δελφίς (delphís), "dolphin",[2] which was related to the Greek δελφύς
        (delphus), "womb".[2] The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning "a 'fish' with a womb".[3] The
        name was transmitted via the Latin delphinus[4] (the romanization of the later Greek δελφῖνος – delphinos[2]),
        which in Medieval Latin became dolfinus and in Old French daulphin, which reintroduced the ph into the word
        "Dolphin". The term mereswine (that is, "sea pig") has also historically been used.[5]</p>

    <h3>Hybridization</h3>
    <p>In 1933, three hybrid dolphins beached off the Irish coast; they were hybrids between Risso's and bottlenose
        dolphins.[15] This mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. In captivity, a bottlenose
        and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring.[16] A common-bottlenose hybrid lives at SeaWorld
        California</p>
    <h4>Evolution</h4>
    <p>Dolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They are
        related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million
        years ago.[20</p>
